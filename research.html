        <h2>Research Interests</h2>
        <p class="leftjustify">My research centers on the spatial distribution and evolution of star formation in nearby galaxies, with a particular focus on ultraviolet (UV) emission as a tracer of recent star-forming activity. I use multi-wavelength imaging—primarily from GALEX and the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S4G)—to study surface brightness and color profiles, identifying trends such as UV disk truncation, color gradients, and extended UV emission. These features provide insight into the physical processes regulating star formation in disks, including gas depletion and star formation quenching.
        <br /><br />
        In addition to my core work on disk evolution and UV color gradients, I’ve also contributed to studies examining the role of stellar bars in shaping star formation patterns, and the connection between black hole mass and host galaxy properties. These complementary projects provide broader context for understanding how internal structures and nuclear activity fit into the larger picture of galaxy evolution. Through both targeted case studies and large statistical samples, I aim to uncover the physical processes driving star formation and quenching in the nearby universe.</p>
